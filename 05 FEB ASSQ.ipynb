    "'''The four pillars of OOPs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object without having to worry about how it works.\n",
    "For example, a Car object might have an engine property, but the programmer does not need to know how the engine works in order to use the Car object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation allows programmers to group together data and methods into a single unit. \n",
    "This makes the code easier to understand and maintain. \n",
    "For example, a Car object might have a start() method and a stop() method. \n",
    "These methods are encapsulated within the Car object, so the programmer does not need to know how they work in order to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. \n",
    "This allows programmers to reuse code and create more complex objects. \n",
    "For example, a SportsCar class might inherit from the Car class. \n",
    "This means that the SportsCar class would have all of the properties and methods of the Car class, \n",
    "plus any additional properties and methods that are specific to SportsCar objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. \n",
    "This allows programmers to write code that is more generic and flexible. \n",
    "For example, a Car object might be able to drive, but it might also be able to fly. \n",
    "This is because the Car object is polymorphic. It can take on the form of a car or a flying car.'''\n"
